## Introduction and Problem Setup

### Machine Learning in RKHS

**Goal**: Study regression in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS) and understand when kernel methods are "easy" or "hard".

**Setting**: 
- Input space `X`, output space `Y = ℝ`
- Training data `{(x_i, y_i)}_{i=1}^n` drawn i.i.d. from distribution `ρ`
- RKHS `H` with reproducing kernel `K: X × X → ℝ`
- Regularized empirical risk minimization

**Key Questions**:
1. What makes a learning problem easy vs. hard for kernel methods?
2. How do spectral properties of the kernel affect learning rates?
3. When can we achieve optimal minimax rates?

### Connection to Linear Regression

**Linear Case Reminder**: For linear regression with `f(x) = w^T x`:
```
Optimal solution: w* = Σ^{-1} h
Regularized solution: ŵ_λ = (Σ̂ + λI)^{-1} ĥ
```
where `Σ = E[xx^T]` and `h = E[xy]`.

**Geometric Interpretation**: 
- `Σ` describes the "shape" of the input distribution
- Regularization `λI` effectively filters out small eigenvalues
- Alignment between `w*` and dominant eigenvectors of `Σ` affects difficulty

---

## From Linear to Kernel Regression

### Feature Map Perspective

**Kernel as Feature Map**: Any kernel `K(x,x')` corresponds to feature map `Φ: X → H`:
```
K(x,x') = ⟨Φ(x), Φ(x')⟩_H
```

**Translation to Kernel Setting**:
- `x` → `Φ(x)` (feature mapping)
- `w` → `f ∈ H` (function in RKHS)
- `Σ = E[xx^T]` → `Σ = E[Φ(x) ⊗ Φ(x)]` (covariance operator)
- `h = E[xy]` → `h = E[yΦ(x)]` (mean embedding)

### Covariance Operator

**Definition**: Linear operator `Σ: H → H` defined by:
```
⟨f, Σg⟩_H = E[f(x)g(x)] for all f,g ∈ H
```

**Alternative Form**:
```
Σf = E[⟨f, Φ(x)⟩_H Φ(x)]
```

**Properties**:
- **Self-adjoint**: `⟨f, Σg⟩ = ⟨Σf, g⟩`
- **Positive semi-definite**: `⟨f, Σf⟩ ≥ 0`
- **Trace-class**: Under boundedness assumptions

### Regularized Kernel Regression

**Population Version**:
```
f_λ = arg min_{f∈H} [E[(y - f(x))²] + λ‖f‖²_H]
Solution: f_λ = (Σ + λI)^{-1} h
```

**Empirical Version**:
```
f̂_λ = arg min_{f∈H} [1/n Σᵢ(yᵢ - f(xᵢ))² + λ‖f‖²_H]
Solution: f̂_λ = (Σ̂ + λI)^{-1} ĥ
```

where:
```
Σ̂ = 1/n Σᵢ Φ(xᵢ) ⊗ Φ(xᵢ)
ĥ = 1/n Σᵢ yᵢ Φ(xᵢ)
```

## Spectral Structure and Geometric Intuition

### Eigenvalue Decay and Problem Difficulty

**Spectral Decomposition**: Assume `Σ` has eigenvalue decomposition:
```
Σ = Σᵢ σᵢ ⟨·, eᵢ⟩ eᵢ
```
where `σ₁ ≥ σ₂ ≥ σ₃ ≥ ...` and `{eᵢ}` are orthonormal eigenfunctions.

**Polynomial Decay**: Common assumption is:
```
σᵢ ≍ i^{-β} for β > 0
```

**Geometric Interpretation**:
- **Large β**: Fast eigenvalue decay → "easy" problem
- **Small β**: Slow eigenvalue decay → "hard" problem
- **β = 0**: All eigenvalues equal → isotropic case

### Regularization Effects

**Filtering Interpretation**: Regularized solution:
```
f_λ = Σᵢ (σᵢ/(σᵢ + λ)) ⟨h, eᵢ⟩ eᵢ
```

**Filter Function**: `σᵢ/(σᵢ + λ)` acts as filter:
- If `σᵢ ≫ λ`: Keep this component (≈ 1)
- If `σᵢ ≪ λ`: Filter out this component (≈ 0)

**Effective Cutoff**: Components with `σᵢ ≲ λ` are effectively ignored.

### Problem Difficulty Examples

**Easy Case**: Target function aligned with large eigenvalues
```
f* = Σᵢ₌₁ᵏ αᵢ eᵢ (k small)
```
→ Small regularization `λ` sufficient

**Hard Case**: Target function aligned with small eigenvalues
```
f* = Σᵢ₌ₖ^∞ αᵢ eᵢ (large k, or slow decay)
```
→ Need very small `λ`, but then overfitting

---

## Source Conditions and Regularity

### Source Condition Definition

**General Source Condition**: Function `f† ∈ H` satisfies source condition of order `α ≥ 0` if:
```
f† = Σ^α v† for some v† ∈ H with ‖v†‖_H < ∞
```

**Interpretation**:
- `α = 0`: No additional regularity (`f† ∈ H`)
- `α > 0`: Function lies in range of `Σ^α` (smoother)
- `α = 1`: Function in range of `Σ` (most natural case)

### Examples of Source Conditions

**α = 0**: General RKHS functions
```
f† ∈ H
```

**α = 1**: Functions in range of covariance operator
```
f† = Σv† for some v† ∈ H
```

**α = 1/2**: Intermediate regularity
```
f† = Σ^{1/2}v† for some v† ∈ H
```

### Connection to Smoothness

**Sobolev Spaces**: For Sobolev RKHS `H^s(ℝ^d)`, source condition relates to additional smoothness:
- Target function has smoothness `s + α`
- Higher `α` means smoother target function
- Smoother functions are easier to approximate

---

## Universal RKHS and Approximation Theory

### Approximation vs. Estimation

**Error Decomposition**:
```
L(f̂_λ) - L(f*) = [L(f̂_λ) - L(f_λ)] + [L(f_λ) - L(f*)]
                    ↑                     ↑
               Estimation Error      Approximation Error
```

**Approximation Error**: How well can RKHS `H` approximate optimal predictor?

### Universal Kernels

**Definition**: RKHS `H` is **universal** if:
```
inf_{f∈H} E[(y - f(x))²] = inf_{f:X→ℝ} E[(y - f(x))²]
```

**Equivalent Condition**: `H` is dense in `L²(X,ρ_X)` where `ρ_X` is marginal distribution of `x`.

**Examples of Universal Kernels**:
- Gaussian RBF kernel: `K(x,x') = exp(-‖x-x'‖²/(2σ²))`
- Laplacian kernel: `K(x,x') = exp(-‖x-x'‖/σ)`

### Approximation Error Analysis

**Projection Interpretation**: For universal RKHS:
```
inf_{f∈H} E[(y - f(x))²] = ‖f_ρ - P_H f_ρ‖²_{L²(ρ_X)}
```
where `f_ρ(x) = E[y|x]` is the regression function and `P_H` is projection onto `H`.

**Key Insight**: Approximation error depends on how well `H` can approximate the true regression function.

## Learning Theory for Kernel Methods

### Basic Learning Bound

**Standard Result**: Under boundedness assumptions, with high probability:
```
L(f̂_λ) - L(f*) ≲ 1/(λn) + λ
```

**Optimization**: Balance gives `λ* ≍ n^{-1/2}`, yielding rate `O(n^{-1/2})`.

**Components**:
- `1/(λn)`: Estimation error (decreases with `λ`)
- `λ`: Approximation/regularization bias (increases with `λ`)

### Improved Rates under Source Conditions

**Source Condition Benefit**: If `f† = Σ^α v†`, then:
```
L(f̂_λ) - L(f*) ≲ 1/(λn) + λ^{2α+1}
```

**Optimal Rate**: Balance gives `λ* ≍ n^{-1/(2α+2)}`, yielding:
```
L(f̂_λ*) - L(f*) ≲ n^{-(2α+1)/(2α+2)}
```

**Examples**:
- `α = 0`: Rate `n^{-1/2}` (standard)
- `α = 1`: Rate `n^{-3/4}` (better)
- `α → ∞`: Rate `n^{-1}` (parametric)

### Saturation Phenomenon

**Saturation at α = 1**: For `α > 1`, the rate doesn't improve beyond `n^{-3/4}`.

**Reason**: Algorithm cannot exploit additional regularity beyond certain threshold.

**Implication**: Source condition of order 1 is often the practical limit for standard kernel methods.

## Effective Dimension and Complexity

### Effective Dimension

**Definition**: For regularization parameter `λ`, the effective dimension is:
```
N(λ) = tr[(Σ + λI)^{-1}Σ] = Σᵢ σᵢ/(σᵢ + λ)
```

**Interpretation**: 
- Number of "active" directions in the feature space
- Roughly counts eigenvalues larger than `λ`

**Properties**:
- `N(0) = rank(Σ)` (possibly infinite)
- `N(∞) = 0`
- Decreasing function of `λ`

### Polynomial Eigenvalue Decay

**Assumption**: `σᵢ ≍ i^{-β}` for `β > 0`.

**Effective Dimension**: For this case:
```
N(λ) ≍ λ^{-1/β}
```

**Interpretation**:
- `β` close to 0: Slow decay, large effective dimension
- `β` large: Fast decay, small effective dimension

**Learning Rates**: Under polynomial decay and source conditions:
```
Rate ≍ n^{-(2α+1)/(2α+β+1)}
```

## Concentration Inequalities

### Hoeffding vs. Bernstein Bounds

**Hoeffding's Inequality**: For bounded random variables:
```
P(|S_n - E[S_n]| ≥ t) ≤ 2exp(-2nt²/B²)
```
where `B` is the bound on the range.

**Bernstein's Inequality**: For random variables with bounded variance:
```
P(|S_n - E[S_n]| ≥ t) ≤ 2exp(-nt²/(2σ² + Bt/3))
```
where `σ²` is the variance and `B` bounds the range.

### Application to Kernel Methods

**Hoeffding Case**: Leads to estimation error `≍ 1/(λn)`

**Bernstein Case**: Can achieve estimation error `≍ 1/(λn²)` under favorable conditions

**Improved Bound**: With Bernstein inequality:
```
L(f̂_λ) - L(f*) ≲ 1/(λn²) + λ^{2α+1}
```

**Optimal Rate**: `λ* ≍ n^{-2/(2α+3)}`, giving rate `n^{-2(2α+1)/(2α+3)}`.

---

## Optimal Learning Rates

### Minimax Theory

**Minimax Rate**: For function class `F` and sample size `n`:
```
inf_{f̂} sup_{f∈F} E[L(f̂) - L(f*)]
```

**Key Parameters**:
- `α`: Source condition (regularity of target)
- `β`: Eigenvalue decay (effective dimension)

### Optimal Rates Table

| Source α | Decay β | Hoeffding Rate | Bernstein Rate |
|----------|---------|----------------|----------------|
| 0        | any     | n^{-1/2}       | n^{-2/3}       |
| 1        | 1       | n^{-3/4}       | n^{-4/5}       |
| α        | β       | n^{-(2α+1)/(2α+β+1)} | n^{-2(2α+1)/(2α+3)} |

### Interpretation

**Easy Problems**: 
- Large `α` (smooth target)
- Large `β` (fast eigenvalue decay)
- Achieve nearly parametric rates

**Hard Problems**:
- Small `α` (rough target)  
- Small `β` (slow eigenvalue decay)
- Stuck at slower nonparametric rates

**No Free Lunch**: For any algorithm, there exist hard problem instances that force slow convergence.

## Mathematical Foundations

### Operator Theory in Hilbert Spaces

**Compact Operators**: Operator `T: H → H` is compact if it maps bounded sets to relatively compact sets.

**Spectral Theorem**: For compact self-adjoint operator `T`:
```
T = Σᵢ λᵢ ⟨·, eᵢ⟩ eᵢ
```
where `λ₁ ≥ λ₂ ≥ ...` are eigenvalues and `{eᵢ}` are eigenfunctions.

**Trace Class**: Operator with `Σᵢ |λᵢ| < ∞`.

### Inverse Problems Theory

**Forward Problem**: Given parameter `θ`, observe `y = A(θ) + noise`

**Inverse Problem**: Given observation `y`, recover `θ`

**Ill-posedness**: Small changes in `y` can cause large changes in recovered `θ`

**Regularization**: Add penalty term to stabilize inversion:
```
θ_λ = arg min [‖y - A(θ)‖² + λ‖θ‖²]
```

**Source Condition**: Assumes `θ = A*φ` for some `φ` (regularity assumption)

### Probability Theory

**Concentration of Measure**: Sums of independent random variables concentrate around their expectation.

**Sub-Gaussian Variables**: Random variable `X` is sub-Gaussian with parameter `σ` if:
```
E[exp(tX)] ≤ exp(σ²t²/2) for all t ∈ ℝ
```

**Rademacher Complexity**: Measure of function class complexity:
```
R_n(F) = E[sup_{f∈F} |1/n Σᵢ εᵢ f(xᵢ)|]
```
where `εᵢ` are independent Rademacher variables.

### Functional Analysis

**Sobolev Spaces**: For domain `Ω ⊆ ℝ^d` and `s ≥ 0`:
```
H^s(Ω) = {f: ‖f‖²_{H^s} = Σ_{|α|≤s} ‖D^α f‖²_{L²} < ∞}
```

**Embedding Theorems**: Sobolev embedding relates function smoothness to continuity/boundedness.

**Fourier Analysis**: Functions can be decomposed into frequency components:
```
f(x) = ∫ f̂(ω) e^{i⟨ω,x⟩} dω
```

### Kernel Theory

**Positive Definite Kernels**: Function `K: X × X → ℝ` such that for any finite set `{x₁,...,x_n}` and coefficients `{c₁,...,c_n}`:
```
Σᵢ,ⱼ cᵢ cⱼ K(xᵢ, xⱼ) ≥ 0
```

**Reproducing Property**: For RKHS `H` with kernel `K`:
```
f(x) = ⟨f, K(·,x)⟩_H for all f ∈ H, x ∈ X
```

**Mercer's Theorem**: For compact domain and continuous kernel:
```
K(x,x') = Σᵢ λᵢ φᵢ(x) φᵢ(x')
```
