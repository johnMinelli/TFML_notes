The goal of machine learning based on the database you are remember that is the number of features. So we need the sum of space functions H which is called the weighted space and the other select the function in. So the basic requirement of H is that each element are functions. The next requirement depend on us. So reproducing H space are the simplest choice. So the first requirement is that H is a vector space. Because we can use linear methods, is that H as some topology? So the way is normal and the. Analysis you know that is how to use functional which is the extension of Calculus 1 and Calculus 2 to deal with infinite dimensional vector space. So you know that there are many possible choice, but we ask more. Age is space. This minister the normal isn't used by a star product. Why this is important? Why this simplify our life? I record you 3 properties. 1st there exists a basis man that that's a basis for me is a normal basis so that we can represent each other in terms of the sequence of each Fourier coefficient. This means that when you deal with inner spaces, you can think of infinite factors. So if you are familiar with Benazine Rd. you can simply extend your tools to different factors. Clearly you have to pay a price because there is is very strategic condition that your sequence is fine, but there are some problems. You have to show the existence. But essentially we are the second point which is very important as that we have the notion of complement. So what does it mean that age node is the closest of space of age was because we are setting and you define H bar the size of half in H such that F again an element of naughty is 0 for all of naughty nature. This is a coastal space. And you have a natural decomposition for any F in each you can write F is the sum of 2 elements. The first one is in each node, the second one is in nature not but the Nicholas orthogonal and the normal is given by the Pythagoras theorem. So the picture is like this is your age Note. No perpendicular. This is a feature of interspaces. There is a famous theorem shows that if you are in back space and this property also for any H node this is the interspace you took. Property is that linear functional on H can be capitalized very easily. It is a map from H to R is a function. H is linear and continuous. Remember that the game if H is five dimensional. All the inner function are continuous, but we need a continuity. The UK, the resistor the unit G in nature, such as that the action on an element F is simply the scarf of F. OK, the last property I need to recall here is the following one. When you prove theorem existence theorem, you like to have compact set because on compact set you have existence in Rd. This is equivalent essentially to require that it is close and bounded bounded. If there is phase is in three-dimensional space, this is not true. The ball are not compound. But there is a famous theorem that all true in spaces, but in space is easier factor. If you take a bowl of rubbish R, this is compa with respect. Space is the star with topology. Remember that topology means that a fan converge to have in the big topology if a fan against the G in edge converge. So topology is nice for us because we reduce the problem to the convergence in a linear map might not be. Yes, you can find linear maps that are not continuous. These example are very pathological. The example you keep a number basis which is a basis with respect to the linear structure and by using the. So there are examples where a is not continuous but is like measurability. You will find a map but which is not continuous. Or you can publish a paper essentially so no problem so. The last requirement 4 is that for us what is important is given X you are in this FX is. So we want to control this is important to control this. So we want to use the normal space to control this guy, at least locally. So that requires that exist G such that as you will see, this is the key property defined by the. So to remarks to remarks, what is your favorite example of inverse space of function? Use one measure. The normal is simply given by this formula and the definition that is the function is final all the one product you true and equals to 1. Why? Remember that this condition imply that if a fan converges to 0 in nature to 0 by this you get that FX goes to 0 for all X. Now you go to the seat. This. Is. Your seat, the other wave, the attic wave. This is 1. This is that's two, that's three, and so on. Notice that this is one, this is one, this is 1. So you get the square, the square of 11. The square of 0 is 0. So this is the I of the 8 is 1. The base become shorter and shorter so that will be shorter after. But now you are misty, you are here and sometimes you are 0, but sometimes you are one, because every cycle there is a piece that is 1 around your point. So FX does not converge to you for all X, not on that many points. So we are producing space R example where all the properties are satisfied. Let me give you the. Definition to provide some examples reproducing kernel in the space. Any set is not important. Any structure age is called reproducing kernel in the space if age is in the space with scalar problem. So it is a vector space, it is a normal space and there is a scar problem. Fine, the other man of HR functions. So you can extend this definition to complex case without any problem. See because it is in the space you have two operations, the sum, the multiplication by the star problem they are given by 1 twice definition that is F + g and point X is FX plus and Lambda FX is 1 FX and G are in H, Lambda R inner H Now the property reproduction property. For each X in X exists AK axis in H such that F at point X is F OK yeah, this color from the nature for all A OK this is domain problem. OK, before to give an example I have to say 2 remarks. The reproducing property is equivalent to. For all X in yes, the resist content C such that this could be do not have FX from H to R Based on our definition of sanction C is linear. This condition is appeared to require that is continuous by OK. So this is the way where you stated the essential. This is the reason why we require this condition. But if you are familiar with the topology, is also equivalent to, for any convergent sequence, the convergent F in nature. Remember that this means that FN minus F norm in nature, the limits to 0 implies that Fr it is FX funnel X Yeah. So just a question. So CX is a constant, yes, depends on X, but what means X and CX? Yes, before. I'm sorry. So it means that the convergence in a imply from twice convergence. So the second mark is the following. We are producing kernel in the species are nice. This means that we can use simple mathematics. Neural networks does not satisfy do not satisfy any of the They are not enough space. There is not enough, there is not a reproducing property, there is that they are not in the space. So busy this you fly in business class. They are very powerful, but you have to pay a lot if you want to do mathematics. It is more cost. You are in Geneva now. The spaces are because of mathematics, but sometime you know the example but you do not know that they are so the first example. I will give you the example in order, but you can extend measures. So H is the function in a 2 where the X is the back measure such that the Fourier transform is 0 for all Omega which are not the minus. R is a parameter OK, which is the fittest form is a unitary map from L2 onto L2 which has a simple expression where you deal with functionality which are in the text section of L1 and L2 that is given by the choice of the factoria is Sometimes it's not a π, sometimes it's a π as you prefer the best ways to find it. For one, it's not possible that you can so and no so you have an invention formula. Ng is also you know what? Notice that that it is more or less the same form over here there is a mind. So now I will show you that this is a reproducing. So assume that yes, Sir, yes, yes, yes, yeah, yeah. This is a good question because if your son are 250, so if you make the full collection this is not, but it is you can show that it's not. So you fix the bag 110 whatever, we will see the role of art. OK, so are we not sure but that is closed but it's very easy and now I have to prove the reprodution properties so. In H we know the Fourier is back to the map and the inference is the fourier -1. This is the Fourier theorem. So you can write FX as the P inverse of the first form. Apply the Fourier first form. Accept this equality. Because we are in a 2 is for almost X in X. Now look to this guy. Remember that by definition is in a 2 and. If they multiply this by the characteristic function over by, this is the stupid function. Due to my assumption, the fact that is supported in this interval, this is now this is in L2, this is in L2 is subtracted so the project is in L1. So now I have to compute the inverse of the Fourier's form of a function which is 14 and two and a one. So I can use my formula. A factor is integral of R. Is important that I put here the function, but the internal is between my R Now call this part GX Omega bar. The reason the part is. In minutes. So GX Omega, yes. Notice that Omega is the variable and X is a label which is this element. So this is F Omega over line GX Omega Omega. But this is the scalar product in a 2 because we are using convex now. But I have to put the so you can write this as GX. Let me write the Omega to remember that space. Now you know the Fourier is a unit map. This means that this is the same that computing the scar problem in the space. And now you see the name this is and we get a spot of what does it means that remember that Jack is A1 and A2 because it is a section demolishes the purpose right now so you can use the formula. Now I have to put an X here because it is a function. This is X prime. The variable that enter and this means that. You have the integral P -, r and RA to π E Omega at minus X prime the Omega and this is a simple computation. So that after some configuration there are some position KX at point X prime is one. The sync over 2π RX minus X prime where sync of T is 70 / t is different from zero is another. This is called C karna. Now this delta this depends on all. So if you change R, you change. OK, so now I will give you a different characterization. We just bring the name initial producing kernel. H is the introduced. OK, so when you have H you have K axis. K axis is an element of H so it is a function which depend on extra variable. And so you define so K from X time X to R and if you apply this formula with KX here you put K extract, you get the disease KXKX. So the kernel is defined in terms of two key object, the two function defining the reclusive property and the scalar product in H the Max. Property K define K axis if you. Freeze the first variable, you get a function I which is precise K axis. A different way to provide this equation. Second property if interchange the raw of KX and X prime. Due to the fact that the inner product is symmetric, this is symmetric. 3rd property fix a sequence of points, similar points in accent. You can think this as our input point. Fix a sequence of numbers R and compute this district object sum over I and drive from one to I. The coefficient and your kernel evaluated in the first bones. Plug in definition this answer in the first term, the second one the second term. So you got this this. You can write this in a different way. Introduce this and times and matrix. We play a central role of machine learning whose elementals are right to see as a connector and this is standard. You can write this as C transpose Ki at CA disease. This means that this matrix is symmetric and semi positive defined plus property. Fix KX and run X over all our space. You take the span, the linear combination enclosure, the space. So what does it means? Is that H is the station defined by K axis, which are defined in terms of the kernel and the kernel also define the star for the measure at the base of the forming theorem, which has has been proven by many motors in many different contexts. So from your grandfather provides in the past the proof. The theorem is the following. I put calling to name and more. This is in the context of. This is a constant of probability KB, the function variable, the next color such that is the medical and how we are arriving. For all family points in X and coefficient, then there exist a unique producing kernel in the space agent OK such that it's reproducing kernel is OK. So the first comment because this is important for Mathematicia, it is a nicer result. There is a 1 to 1 correspondence between reproducing kernel spaces and can I recall this, but for application is essential. The definition I gave before things of the example of pending is very difficult. You cannot implement in a computer. You need to get a form some very deep result. The bandwidth are defined simply. You can explain this to a student of a school not to be transformed. OK, so an application the kernel allows to forget all the functional analysis, implement the computer, the sketch to prove. Sketch. So I have the kernel is given first up for all acts in my space. Chaos which is a function from X2R is defined not. Then you define H node as the span or Ki Cannot put the bar because I have no topology. This is a little space. Now on this I would like to define and by definition F is the final sum efficient Some point CIXII will not write the notation G the same. Prime. What is the idea which is the basic product of the? So now we have the scalar product between this element you want to define. Here there is the prime over the index. Now it's a sketch because you have to do 2 days. But they have these are not. So there are many different decomposition. You have to show that this definition is in the second. This is easy to show that this is a star problem. It is symmetric because this is symmetric. This is positive definite because this is semi positive definite. So now this is only. This means that F equal to 0. This is related to the OK nice. So H node is vector space and normal with the scalar product. It is a because to be in the space you need to complete. Just on the way to find edge to be, there is an extra point that in general the completion of the space is a family sequence function also satisfied. OK, now I give you 2 examples going up and down. So the first example is the reproducing kernel space, the Gaussian. X is Rd. KXX, prime is 8 minus the difference the square. This is the norm in AD divided by Sigma. Let's see this. Nice. This is very popular. Now we have to prove that this OK symmetry is very simple. Now to show the fact that this is semi positive defined, I need to recall the fact that the creator's form of the Gaussian is a Gaussian, but there are some factors. Let me check the position. Yes. So now insert your position. So I have to go here. I have used this integral expression and for me this X is the difference because the is the difference. Nice. So notice that this time is finite. So no problem, you can interchange the sum of the integral. Let me write, sorry, this is independent so I can go out the sum, the sum, and now the miracle. The exponential of the difference is the product of the exponential. Now the index I is on here, the index drive is on there. So this means that. You. Can take this with that. You take. This is real. There is a Plaza. This is a complex number. This is the same complex number with the line. Second example which we've used by Lorenzo are sober spaces. The definition is a nightmare deep. This is age of graphical is the family of F in L 2 / G with the special effect measure such a delta as is a positive parameter. If you take the modules of the free transformer, this is always piloted because the normal alpha, but you have some more. They need to go a little bit faster in order to compensate this factor bigger as stronger distribution. And if this is fine, you call it the norm of AU matrix. If S is an integer, you can give a different characterization term of in what cases these objects. Still, if this is not an integral, is a multiple, but you ask your favorite analyst if S is bigger than d / 2. Mr. Somberlon show that HSRB is continuously invited in the space of the continuous function. With the topology of the convergence, this means that a friend converge in F. If only for any K compactor you should over X in CFNXFX. So if X is compacted, the usual topology, otherwise you have to be a little bit more subtle. But for this you get that the map F your fax is continuous. So let's see as this point, this compactor. So adjust is. Now you go up on start, you display the subway spaces to machine level, but call you and it's very simple. You can provide the kernel. Is this formula B depending on the parameter? No. He is interviewed by Andrea is the best function for second time. There is non explicit expression. You pay the price. DS is d / 2 + 1 / 2. We have an axis. It is like the Gaussian kernel. So. The. Light is hard because it's the Third Point of view, which is the point of view of people working in maxim. This is why machine learning people know very well the producing space and mathematician the feature X space. You fix egg in the space. Any but you have a map X. This is called the future space. And this is called. Now you can do the following for each element. You can think these as a special parameter. You fix a parameter, you can define a function. By taking the scar, probably between your set of parameter and. Notice that the dependence on X is here. The dependence on one is the commencer. The dependence on X is arbitrary. It depends on what is linear neural networks. Have a non linearity also in the parameter. Now define H this way. For observation, this is. The element of HR function No, the foot requirement is OK. You know which is not over. H is the space with. So you are the center, you build this kernel, you are the reproducing kernel best state. The parameterization is not unique. We get the quality if and only if the difference, just to be sure, no. So this is a side as a side the moment there is only I will show you now and also. So the reason is why we get we have many different realization. So the difference the difference between the two parameter is in the orthogonal complement of deceptor. This means that after the composition. In two pieces, each of them orthogonal, just the same function. Is the difference, is the last. Is the answer to your points. Given H exist a unique West in this space such that so you have unique. Next you mean and you can choose your parameter in this space, which is generated by your future mapper. And the norm of F nature as given by the reproduction is precisely the norm of. So you cannot use the norm of F, you have to restrict to this space. This means that equivalent this is brief over all the parameter such that is equal. So to answer to your question you have to do a little bit of subtlety. Instead of using the scar proton Nath you have to use the input because we are need a space that is already achieved and is given by me and myself. OK, so he provide some examples and interpretation. Just a question. So in the last part, W is a is a function in the space or no? The one on top like when you say if and only if the view. So each W is a function. W is a parameter. It's not a function, OK, It's a parameter in F So you got F, you got the parameter in this place, OK, and you construct the function. OK, so this is a different parameter. OK, but it can happen. OK, So what when this happens this equal to delta so you can use terminality. The. Difference of your parameter can be orthogonal to this guy, and this is precisely the condition. OK, so FW is a puncture. Is this clear in this? Example so I. Change the order X is exacta. Fix a family P1PP of functions. No condition your favorite factor. Define F as RP with the use of. OK, and define CX. A connection for your function. Now West is a parameter for us, a vector of position West X is. But this is the Duroscar product in AP so that it is the sum over R for one 50. That is H is because P is finite. You span over your sight function. OK, now clearly you can see from this equation if the field are not a linearly independent, because I do not put any condition. Many different parameter can give you the same part. What is the norm of H? You've got all the parameter. Such that you can write the normal path is the of all the possible way. Because we are in a space, this minimum is actually OK. So notice that if these functions are linearly independent, only one way to write and this means that this family is an orthonormal table. So submission remarks, if your set of feature is independent and we want people is no problem. But if we want to pick R linearly dependent, the set is not the base, it is a frame. What does it mean? So this is not a normal family, but the past California. Also, you can compute the normal fact by writing the coefficient OK, so America, which is the point of view of learning. Assume assume that this is your space, your space you have point here and the enemy the feature functions this is X1. Which is 0. So this is the picture. Done by monthly petition. Now you have a feature map. This is access power feature space. You plug in the points. In the MacDonald so. Now remember that these functions are elemental sport, so in this most case you can recall these the new points. This is your arbitrary point experimental. And now in this space all you can see are. So in this space is not linear the function. Here 0 on the blue is positive on the origin. So what does it means by means of the feature space you pass from nonlinear function to? This is called the kernel, so. Gap you have. Your space you have function which are you map the point in a bigger interspace. So X and a structure F is an interspace. And here you can consider only. So you linearize the problem by the current OK half an hour to break with this idea we have. And by means of the theorem it is uniquely refined time of the kernel, but the connection is given by this. Now the idea is I would like to have a nice property on HI would like to test this property on the kernel. Why? Because this is. So the first example is continuity. OK, you know the to discuss continuity we have to assume that X is a locally compact topological space. So there is a theorem. It is not so difficult to show that age. It is a subset of the continuous function. This means that every element in nature is the function that is the element a regular if belief. For all acts in KX, remember it is the camera, it's going to be frozen. Second variable is continuous. And for each explore in its there is a compact set where X is there of a neighborhood. So you have a complete characterization on the continuity in time of property of the can. The first one is the natural reaction need to be able to function and then there is a technical condition that locally it bounded. The Canon is what we bounded conversation if K regarded as function too variable is continuous. A. Lot of his assumptions for this part and H If so, if we ask, the reproducing kernel in the space of a continuous function is enough to have a continuous. So the variety of the kernel is induced allegory of the interspace. For example, all the kernel we introduced in the previous lecture are. So for example the cashew kernel. Is a continuous function, but variable H is history. Again, as before checking a property of a variable, provide a property on the full edge. Second property is separability. Remember that H is separable. Is equivalent to require that to resist the base, which is the portable, which means that a is final or is equal to north. So separable spaces are easy to do. So we want to characterize separable page and the following is a sufficient condition. X is separable. The space X equality is really separable A the elements of H are the function H is separable. So nice position the kernel, nice position. Next provide you the factor hatch the last which is important machine learning property. Integrability. Why it is important? Remember that we introduced the square also and the correspondence spectral list, and we know that this is finite. So if you want to build an algorithm, the basic required is that H is. Since we do not know products we have crossed this problem. Now fix for the moment one them and look to this condition. OK, So what is the property? Assuming that the element of HR square integral function, we have a complete characterization as before for raw X almost on X in X KX is in two which is precise the same condition as before. For continuity we require that these element are in the right space, which is not enough for all F in two. The map, the Max. What is in it? So look to this condition. It can be rephrasing in a different way. Fix the X, compute the integral OK X which is fixed up. Now I need an extra variable which is the integration variable. The integration is over X prime. This is the integral of the Rex. Remember the definition. So this is the integral operation of Kerner K applied to the function. This is the condition tell you that the integral operator can take. Is well defined, so again the requirement that age determine between ages 3 integrable reduced to test the property involved with the kernel and the major. So in general this is a difficult problem and. If you do 2 sufficient condition if. If you take the integration of, respect the two variables with respect to probability measure of the square that H is. So if you are familiar with integral operator, this means that LK is a operator. So again, you check this integrity condition, the Colonel, here you are, the divisions of blacks capital. Is that easy enough to any? Where did it go with you? Sorry, I forgot I was missing a piece. Why is this, this and that? So to be clear, if these two are group then you can define this integral and this integral is bounded from the last example that if you have an arbitrary kernel, you can have bounded integral operator without the dispute permission satisfied. But with the repression can they are essentially OK. That's all. If you want this, you have to require that this is for all. OK, so if you have only this condition, you have that H is another one. If you have this condition for all probability distribution OK, so the quantifier is translated and the other condition. You have only one integration. There's accent. Accent is important again. So this is true for all ro accent. Yeah, this is this is comment. There is a condition which is always satisfied if KX is bounded. You have bounded canal because this is a probability distribution and then you get that H is OK. So if you want to have this property for all products, this is a very natural condition the bounds. Otherwise we have to select some more technical. OK, the machine learning. Usually we assume that you can. He's bounded, remember that. So this condition is OK. So summarize. There are many other examples. We also discussed property of disability. Take our method easy. If you need some property on the space H loop to a property on this on the cut. So this final part I will discuss the prospect topics. OK, now X is my face Y which is R for us. I have a function and it's convex and the fixed idea. We have a. Time sector record. That this is a realization of the family of. I and D as about X&Y where X is in X and YY are given by the following rule. Fixed reproducing based H with reproducing. H is the voice displays, so our estimator is the H. Remember the disease dependence on the full set. Disease. Disease which is proportion to the normal, which is positive. So notice that the minimizer. So I have to prove that there exists a minimizer. Is the content of this way? For any Lambda 0, there exist a unique measure of the problem. And. Are in measure of the following project. K is north times north matrix, which is the usual one. Epsilon are the kernel interval OK, and the file is called the kernel estimator, the kernel. OK, some comments. First, there is always the solution, but remember that age is in general in the space. Not only this, this is the nomination anastiology thing. For example, the case of Soviet species you need using equation Carcos transform. This is impossible, but this result tell you that your solution is a linear combination finite. How many times north is the Lambda? And you can find the solution solving a different problem where the all ingredient you need forget H is the kernel on the. So here here only you need to implement the computer is the current. It is very easy for a Notice that since K is matrix is only semi positive defined. This problem in general has many, but each of them provided the section. And notice that the requirement that L is convex in the variable because the action the matrix is linear, this is a quadratic form. This is a convex problem, so that in principle it is easy to provide. So This is why kernel method are low cost. We did 3 flowers on mathematics functionalities very difficult. At the end, the only important thing is the camera and the camera on the examples. Why now we use? There are two points 1. So the algorithm OK, so I can use several spaces or kernel or kernel or your favorite kernel. But you have to decide the idea behind the network that they are able also to learn the kernel. So there is no difficult K. The second point is that if N is very large, this matrix become very very large. You cannot, you cannot as we can see inverting. So we have a meta problem now. Let me check the proof because I want to unwrite the basic property. So number one, big X is X which is one of our point and record that FX is F. So the mouth is now, and it is quickly continuous. Because it's just praxis as a scalar proton, but axis fixed is in your G is precisely the definition of the convergence. Now since we assume continuity convexity here I. The two the norm of effort nature because the space is the Super over G in nature, the norm of G less than one. Now fix G. This map is linear. This is the soup of linear and wiki continuous function. This is convex and over semi continuous. But this is a norm in the space. It is strictly complex. This is a special property of space now. Step 3. This is convex. And continuous this is this purpose of matter. This is pretty convex. The lower semi continuous Lambda is positive. It preserves the property is pretty convex. Now, and the value of the spectator is when we choose OK, what's the number? So remember that I have to minimize and clearly because zero is in the center and the start is 0. This is much the. So the equimum of this quantity is by sure less than I. So let F nature such that the norm of H is bigger than the square root of M Lambda. Notice that this important the Lambda is positive and compute this is. Because this is positive, remember that our loss function takes all the positive numbers. This is positive, you can cancel out. This is lower. Replace this bounder so that the evening room if it is inside the ball. Can you replace my problem? Sorry, yes. Are we sure that such an F with norm at least the square root of So you can have, you can have normal address as you want, design it in the letter space things in output you fix so there's no problem. Now the Lambda is positive. My problem is reduced to now why I need quick continuity? Because theorem ball because of ball is compact 33 convex lower semi continuous continuous function with the right topology theorem. Imply the existence. The existence is based only on the continuity is U. But here the comment this proof can be simplified. They put together continuity because convex function we expect to do the topology of H. The normal topology and convex function are always lower. So I did this part because this is all true for any loss function which are not convex. The convex use only the uniqueness. OK, so now Step 5. FN is the mean of the creature. Notice that we know a bound. Because we are used to the ball. So this is important information. Now I have to show that he has this nice representation. This is independent on the proof of existence recall. Remember that because we fly with the Ryanair, we can express FXI as a scalar problem. This is the key property. Now define HN as the spanner over the XI such that I one. This means that F in HN is a linear combination. Final. This means that FX. This is nice because this can be implemented in the computer only the time on the kernel there is the new point here and the input point the enough to be transformed. Most of the spaces only the. Now this is a finite dimensional space. The dimension of HN is a less than because this linearly dependent. For example if you have two points which are the same points, the dimension is the plus one and this final. So this is the first space we are in the space. What is this all the fashion which are tolerant with this vector, which are the generator of my space? And as I said this morning, Kimberly, 10. As the sum of 2 terms f0 is a linear combination as before when we have a secret time of hand condition F dagger is orthogonal to this. This means that this term applied now this the composition. FXI is the sum. This is 0. By assumption, the empirical risk of alpha is the same than the empirical risk of. So this is but this is not theorem this positive. This is positive. So the value of our functional on an is greater than the value on. I Mustafa. I have to compute this guy, but F is a linear combination because I know that space guy. Remember that this is. So XI here is I have to compute this. Now I have to use a different index. J TJ. KX IF4 XJ at point XI. This is J. This is J. This is XJ which is here. This is XI. But by doing some symmetry, this is the kernel matrix applied to the vector XI. Plus Lambda computer norm square. This is the square product pull to this pressure to sum. But this is precisely. Observe that this proof is independent on the existence, so we can forget about proof. First step, reduce to the fine dimensional problem. Now with topology, but it is ready. How to extend this to sure last alpha? I would like to discuss the case where we use the spell also for spell also. Kernel metal or regularized nature. Remember our problem is now we can use mean as. You have to solve this problem, so I will introduce some nicer operator. Is 1 which is from pH to R and the component I is. So what is as an is the same thing. This is your alpha. You are the inputs and. The. Same operator provide the correspondence What is the? This is an operator. We do a tricky point. We change the definition of scatter plot in Nana one by an art vector 9. This is because we would like to control the size of the vector. Now by using this you are right. As one over north, it is normalization. This is the difference of Yi and this guy which is precise the same operator component I the square. So it is not. Now miser, this is a quadratic 4. Let me denote the minimizer F0. Simplified notation. Take F and right F as H. The place that. Is. Standard. So keep this together and write the norm of the product by using the product so that this is minus SM plus there is the standard is a minus that is the square plus this is the star product and the minus the continuous is the minus. Do the same for these two. That's all right these. OK, there is a tooth now. OK, because this is minimizer, this is a second term, this is a linear term that changes same sinus. So 0 is a minimizer if and only this is zero, so the condition. I have H here and H here. I would like to drop this so I put this on the side I pay price the joint. Because age is arbitrary so I know the minimize. It is a fan so it's my minimizer. So my minimize is minimize if I know is successful. So you can do a different proof by taking the data. But because we are in the best place, I prefer to do it. I am so the second. Is. Yes, Sir, this is. This is the right. But now when I put this on the side, this is the scar. So do a joint change the scar product between the target space and the space. This is the match. So now the dissipation. Now I have to look the guy. There are some. So remember that as and is from age to. This is the key point to your question. As and star is from R and H so I have no time and the computation is very simple on the right toe seat. Seat is in computation. Wow, this you are a vector of coefficient. Provide the function up to this. This is nature, and a point X is precisely so the strange object, but is very natural now. SN start from H, go to a random estaran, go to A2H. So bigger now, trust me, Let's see. For computation this is usual goal. As you can see, this is an operator. Remember what is this notation? You have two vector. So the action of this operator is simply. You know this formula. This means that by the is important. You take a function, you produce a family of coefficient, here inputs point and then use this coefficient to get the. So this operator is injective Y. It's not injective, it is positive. It's never injective. You compute the scar product nature, now the opposite as before. You change the star product because the adjoint of the data which is this is not injected. But remember that the Lambda is strictly positive. This means that your operator is bounded from below, but it is injected, and it's more than injected. It's bounded from below, so it's injected. And so the moment that the condition is. So this is the formula for Mathematicia because this operator is but as we did for the linear. Case clearly the anticipation. Use the inarity, use the sensitivity. Notice that, as before, here there's the so to the universal. Remember that Y is outputs final. This is a vector in Rd. This is the RN. This is the. This is remember. We start from a hand because it is first we go to H we come back to our hand. So this is a linear operator from RN to a hand. What is a linear operator between RN and an end matrix? So it is a matrix. What kind of matrix? So there is a star when you have to pay a price, there is a 1 / r So this is a matrix. So this is a coefficient. So have 0. This is the definition of S star Anna and what is the coefficient? So you go to your favorite analyst, he give you a complicated interstation, but it is an abolition Interstate. Ask your favorite analyst to compute together, keep the kernel with you, kill journalist and then solve this problem. It is a linear problem. Finally, mention of so Thomas the short, What is the difficulty? As we said before, the problem, if you can, it's very, very positive second comment. And then what's happened if Lambda is equal to 0 this this square? Notice that as Anna as a big Hannah. Because it's a rain. So very big. So yeah, you've got a lot of solution, but there is one which is the risk per solution. So the solution is given by. Say former as before, but now you get K, you kill the kernel, you have the kernel, you get the condition under some suitable condition. This matrix is always available. You think for the kernel if your example are different. So you need the output converter and bigger. But the point is that dissolution as it's a regularization problem because it is the minimum of solution. So among all the possible solution that is the problem, you select the one which has minimal. So you put a strong constraint because you just face it very much because I said giving you this information because when I started to learn machine learning name is like Go, this was forbidden. It was the overheating problem after for here people discover that quicker boat Lambda equal to 0 over feet solution. But it generalize well because we are looking for the minimum. So I think it is time to stop here. Thank you very much. And we will see tomorrow by the.
