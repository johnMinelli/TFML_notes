## Introduction and Motivation

### Understanding Neural Network Dynamics at Inference

**Central Question**: How do transformer architectures process and transform input data through their layers?

**Goal**: Develop mathematical framework to understand:
- How token representations evolve through network depth
- Why transformers form effective representations
- How architectural choices affect information processing

**Approach**: Model layer-by-layer transformations as dynamical systems

### Key Assumptions and Limitations

**Mathematical Simplifications**:
- Focus on inference time (not training dynamics)
- Simplified attention mechanisms
- Specific parameter choices for tractability

**Trade-off**: Mathematical rigor vs. practical realism
- Results provide intuition about mechanisms
- Not direct quantitative predictions for real models

---

## Neural ODEs Framework

### Motivation: Deep Networks as Discretized ODEs

**Deep ResNet Structure**:
```
x^{(l+1)} = x^{(l)} + f_θ(x^{(l)})
```

**Interpretation**: Euler method for solving ODE
```
dx/dt = f_θ(x)
```

### Euler Method Review

**Ordinary Differential Equation**:
```
ẋ(t) = f(x(t))
x(0) = x₀
```

**Euler Discretization**:
```
x_{l+1} = x_l + ε f(x_l)
```
where `ε` is step size.

**Convergence Theorem**: As `ε → 0`:
```
sup_{t∈[0,T]} |x_ε(⌊t/ε⌋) - x(t)| → 0
```

### Neural ODE Formulation

**ResNet Layer Update**:
```
x^{(l+1)} = x^{(l)} + ε f_θ(x^{(l)})
```

**Continuous Limit**: As depth `L → ∞` and `ε = 1/L`:
```
ẋ(t) = f_θ(x(t))
```

**Physical Interpretation**:
- **Time**: Network depth
- **Trajectory**: Evolution of data representation
- **Vector Field**: Learned transformation at each layer

---

## Deep ResNets and Continuous Limits

### ResNet Architecture

**Layer Update Rule**:
```
x^{(l+1)} = x^{(l)} + f_θ^{(l)}(x^{(l)})
```

**Output Classification**:
```
y = σ(a^T x^{(L)})
```
where `σ` is softmax function.

### Weight Sharing and Scaling

**Practical Scaling**: `ε_l ∼ 1/L` for large `L`

**Continuous Limit Conditions**:
1. **Weight sharing**: `f_θ^{(l)} = f_θ` for all layers
2. **Proper scaling**: Step size decreases with depth
3. **Smoothness**: `f_θ` sufficiently regular

### Expected Behavior

**Intuitive Picture**: Network flow separates classes
- **Input**: Mixed data points (cats, dogs, etc.)
- **Flow**: Gradually separates classes
- **Output**: Well-separated clusters for easy classification

**Mathematical Goal**: Understand this separation process

## Transformer Architecture Analysis

### Input Processing

**Sentence Tokenization**:
```
"Need a new paper on AI" → ["Need", "a", "new", "paper", "on", "AI"]
```

**Position Encoding**: Add positional information to each token

**High-Dimensional Embedding**:
```
(word, position) → x_i ∈ ℝ^d
```

**Normalization**: Project to unit sphere `S^{d-1}`
```
x_i ∈ S^{d-1} = {x ∈ ℝ^d : ||x|| = 1}
```

### Key Properties

**Exchangeability**: Tokens are indistinguishable by index
- Position information encoded in embedding
- Order-invariant representation: `{x₁, x₂, ..., x_n}`

**Particle Interpretation**: Each token as particle on sphere

### Layer Update Structure

**Two-Stage Process**:
1. **Self-Attention**: Inter-token interactions
2. **Feed-Forward**: Individual token processing (ignored for simplicity)

**Residual Connection**:
```
x_i^{(l+1)} = N(x_i^{(l)} + ε · SelfAttention(x₁^{(l)}, ..., x_n^{(l)}))
```
where `N(·)` projects back to sphere.

---

## Self-Attention as Interacting Particles

### Self-Attention Mechanism

**Standard Formula**:
```
Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax(QK^T/√d_k)V
```

**Per-Token Update**:
```
x_i^{(l+1)} = x_i^{(l)} + ε Σⱼ (exp(β⟨Qx_i^{(l)}, Kx_j^{(l)}⟩)/Z_i) Vx_j^{(l)}
```

**Normalization Factor**:
```
Z_i = Σⱼ exp(β⟨Qx_i^{(l)}, Kx_j^{(l)}⟩)
```

### Simplified Model

**Assumption 1**: Set `Q = K = V = I` (identity matrices)

**Assumption 2**: Set `Z_i = n` (constant normalization)

**Simplified Update**:
```
x_i^{(l+1)} = N(x_i^{(l)} + (ε/n) Σⱼ exp(β⟨x_i^{(l)}, x_j^{(l)}⟩) x_j^{(l)})
```

### Continuous Limit

**As depth `L → ∞` and `ε = 1/L`**:
```
ẋᵢ(t) = P_{x_i(t)}⊥ [(1/n) Σⱼ exp(β⟨x_i(t), x_j(t)⟩) x_j(t)]
```

**Projection Operator**: `P_x⊥` projects onto tangent space of sphere at `x`
```
P_x⊥(v) = v - ⟨v,x⟩x
```

---

## Mean Field Dynamics

### Interacting Particle System

**System of ODEs**:
```
ẋᵢ(t) = P_{x_i(t)}⊥ [(1/n) Σⱼ exp(β⟨x_i(t), x_j(t)⟩) x_j(t)]
```

**Mean Field Structure**: Each particle influenced by average field from all others

**Key Properties**:
1. **Interactions**: Non-local coupling between all particles
2. **Symmetry**: Permutation-invariant dynamics
3. **Conservation**: Dynamics preserve sphere constraint

### Gradient Flow Structure

**Energy Function**:
```
E_β(x₁, ..., x_n) = (1/2n²) ΣᵢΣⱼ exp(β⟨x_i, x_j⟩)
```

**Gradient Relationship**: The dynamics can be written as
```
ẋᵢ = P_{x_i}⊥ ∇_{x_i} E_β
```

**Energy Maximization**: System performs gradient **ascent** (note: no minus sign)

### Fixed Points

**Global Maximum**: All particles at same location
```
x₁ = x₂ = ... = x_n = x* ∈ S^{d-1}
```

**Physical Interpretation**: Complete clustering/synchronization

---

## Clustering Behavior and Fixed Points

### Complete Clustering Theorem

**Main Result**: For `n ≥ 2`, almost every initial condition converges to synchronized state
```
x_i(t) → x* as t → ∞
```

**Proof Strategy**:
1. Identify all fixed points of the system
2. Show non-synchronized fixed points are unstable (saddle points)
3. Use measure theory: saddle points have measure zero basin of attraction

### Fixed Point Analysis

**Synchronized States**: `x₁ = ... = x_n = x*`
- **Energy**: Maximum possible value
- **Stability**: Stable (energy maximum)

**Non-synchronized States**: Various clustering patterns
- **Energy**: Suboptimal values  
- **Stability**: Unstable (at least one unstable direction)

### Practical Implications

**Issue**: Complete clustering gives trivial representation
- All tokens become identical
- Loss of information
- Poor prediction capability

**Question**: What happens before complete clustering?

---

## Metastable States and Intermediate Clustering

### Observed Behavior

**Numerical Simulations**: Starting from uniform distribution
1. **Phase 1**: Initial random state
2. **Phase 2**: Formation of subclusters  
3. **Phase 3**: Gradual merging of subclusters
4. **Phase 4**: Final complete clustering

**Time Scales**: Different phases occur on different time scales

### Metastability

**Definition**: States that appear stable for long periods but eventually evolve

**Mechanism**: 
- Fast dynamics: Formation of subclusters
- Slow dynamics: Merging of subclusters

**Practical Relevance**: Real networks operate in metastable regime

### Parameter Dependence

**Temperature Parameter** `β`: Controls interaction strength
- **High β**: Strong clustering tendency
- **Low β**: Weak interactions, slower clustering

**Key Question**: How does cluster structure depend on `β`?

---

## Large N Limit and PDE Formulation

### Empirical Measure Formulation

**Motivation**: Handle limit `n → ∞` systematically

**Empirical Measure**:
```
μ_n(t) = (1/n) Σᵢ δ_{x_i(t)}
```

**Properties**:
- Lives in space of probability measures on `S^{d-1}`
- Factors out permutation symmetry
- Well-defined limit as `n → ∞`

### Transport Equation

**Vector Field**: Express particle dynamics as integral
```
V[μ](x) = β P_x⊥ ∫_{S^{d-1}} exp(β⟨x,y⟩) y μ(dy)
```

**Transport PDE**:
```
∂μ/∂t + ∇ · (V[μ] μ) = 0
```

**Interpretation**: Evolution of particle density under flow

### Fixed Points in PDE Setting

**Uniform Measure**: `μ₀(dx) = uniform measure on S^{d-1}`
- **Property**: Fixed point of PDE
- **Stability**: Totally unstable

**Delta Measures**: `μ*(dx) = δ_{x*}(dx)` 
- **Property**: Only stable fixed points
- **Interpretation**: Complete clustering states

## Linear Stability Analysis

### Linearization Around Uniform State

**Setup**: Study perturbations around uniform measure `μ₀`

**Linear Operator**: Linearize transport equation around `μ₀`
```

```

**Eigenvalue Problem**: Find eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of `L_β`

### Finite-Dimensional Analogy

**Standard ODE**: `ẏ = f(y)` with fixed point `y*`

**Linearization**: 
```
δẏ = Df(y*) δy
```

**Solution**:
```
δy(t) = exp(t Df(y*)) δy(0)
```

**Growth Modes**: Eigenvectors of `Df(y*)` with eigenvalues `λₖ`

**Dominant Mode**: Largest eigenvalue `λ_max` determines growth

---

## Spectral Analysis and Cluster Formation

### Eigenfunctions and Eigenvalues

**For d = 2 (Circle)**: 
- **Eigenfunctions**: Fourier modes `cos(2πkθ), sin(2πkθ)`
- **Eigenvalues**: `λₖ(β) = β⁻¹ Iₖ(β)` 

**Modified Bessel Functions**: `Iₖ(β)` are modified Bessel functions of first kind

**Dominant Mode**: `k_max(β) = argmax_k λₖ(β)`

### Cluster Prediction

**Linear Stability Result**: Most unstable mode has wavenumber `k_max(β)`

**Predicted Clusters**: `k_max(β)` equally-spaced clusters around circle

**Mechanism**:
1. Small perturbations grow in most unstable direction
2. Rotational symmetry preserved by dynamics  
3. Results in periodic cluster pattern

### Higher Dimensions

**Spherical Harmonics**: Eigenfunctions are spherical harmonics `Y_l^m`

**Degeneracy**: Multiple modes with same growth rate `λ_l(β)`

**Complexity**: Random superposition leads to more complex cluster patterns

**Fixed Points**: Points where `V(x) = 0`

**Stability**: Determined by linearization around fixed point

### Riemannian Geometry on Spheres
