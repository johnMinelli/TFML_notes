## Introduction and Motivation

### The Quest for Principles of Intelligence

**Central Question**: Are there fundamental principles underlying intelligence, analogous to conservation laws in physics?

**Urgency**: With language models potentially replacing human researchers within decades, understanding these principles becomes critical before machines surpass our comprehension abilities.

### Deep Learning Architectures

**Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs)**:
- **Structure**: Input → Hidden Layers → Output
- **Layer Operation**: `h^{(l+1)} = σ(W^{(l)} h^{(l)} + b^{(l)})`
- **Activation Functions**: ReLU, smooth variants (GELU, Swish)
- **Parameter Count**: Billions of weights in modern models

**Transformers**:
- **Core Components**: Self-attention + Feed-forward MLPs
- **Architecture**: Many blocks (20+ layers typical)
- **Key Innovation**: Attention mechanism for sequence modeling

### Training Paradigm

**Objective**: Minimize loss function on training data
```
L(θ) = (1/n) Σᵢ ℓ(fθ(xᵢ), yᵢ)
```

**Optimization**: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) variants
- **Backpropagation**: Efficient gradient computation
- **Mini-batch SGD**: Random subsets for scalability

## Function Approximation Framework

### The Core Problem

**Unknown Target Function**: `f*: X → Y`
- Maps inputs (e.g., images) to outputs (e.g., labels)
- Could be deterministic or probabilistic

**Learning Goal**: Find approximation `f̂` from training data `{(xᵢ, yᵢ)}ᵢ₌₁ⁿ`

### Function Class Requirements

**Two Competing Demands**:

1. **Expressiveness**: Function class must be rich enough
   - Should approximate "most" nonlinear mappings
   - Linear models insufficient for complex patterns

2. **Efficiency**: Parameter count should be manageable
   - Must not grow exponentially with input dimension
   - Enables both computation and generalization

### Three-Stage Process

1. **Approximation**: Choose function class that can represent target
2. **Optimization**: Find best parameters via training data
3. **Generalization**: Ensure good performance on new data

**Key Insight**: Compositional function classes satisfy both requirements optimally.

## Compositionality Theory

### Definition and Ubiquity

**Compositionality**: Building complex systems from simpler components

**Examples Across Domains**:

1. **Language** (Principle of Compositionality):
   - Sentence meaning determined by word meanings + combination rules
   - Enables infinite expressions from finite vocabulary

2. **Computer Science**:
   - Programs built from subroutines and modules
   - Functional programming exploits compositional structure

3. **Cognitive Development**:
   - Children learn simple concepts first, then combinations
   - Curriculum learning mimics this progression

### Mathematical Formulation

**Function Composition**:
```
f = f_L ∘ f_{L-1} ∘ ... ∘ f_1
```

**Constituent Functions**: Each `fᵢ` is "simple" (few parameters, local dependencies)

**Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) Representation**:
- **Nodes**: Represent constituent functions
- **Edges**: Represent data flow/dependencies
- **Layered Structure**: Can be organized into computational layers

---

## Boolean Function Complexity

### Complexity Class P

**Definition**: Class P consists of Boolean functions computable by Turing machine in polynomial time.

**Formal Definition**:
```
P = {f: {0,1}* → {0,1} | ∃ polynomial p, Turing machine M such that
     M computes f in time ≤ p(|input|)}
```

**Practical Interpretation**: Functions computable in "reasonable" time (lifetime of universe).

### Circuit Complexity

**Boolean Circuits**: 
- **Gates**: AND, OR, NOT operations
- **Size**: Number of gates
- **Depth**: Length of longest path from input to output

**P/poly Complexity Class**: Functions computable by polynomial-size circuits

**Key Properties**:
- **Closure under Composition**: If `f, g ∈ P`, then `f ∘ g ∈ P`
- **Variable Binding**: Supports function composition operations
- **Efficient Computation**: All functions in P are "tractable"

### Sparse Boolean Functions

**Definition**: Boolean function depending on "few" variables relative to total input size.

**Examples**:
- **Linear Threshold Functions**: `sign(Σᵢ wᵢxᵢ - θ)`
- **Small-Width Formulas**: Polynomial expressions with bounded degree
- **Decision Trees**: Each path uses few variables

**Key Insight**: Functions in P are essentially compositions of sparse Boolean functions.

---

## Sparse Compositionality

### Formal Definition

**Sparse Compositionality**: Function `f` has sparse compositional structure if:
```
f = g_L ∘ g_{L-1} ∘ ... ∘ g_1
```
where each `gᵢ` depends on at most `k` variables, with `k ≪ d` (total dimension).

**Why "Sparse"?**: Without sparsity constraint, every function is trivially compositional (can compose with identity).

### Graph-Theoretic Representation

**DAG Structure**:
- **Input Nodes**: Original variables `x₁, ..., x_d`
- **Computation Nodes**: Sparse functions of predecessors
- **Output Node**: Final result

**Example - Binary Tree Function**:
```
Level 1: y₁ = g(x₁, x₂), y₂ = g(x₃, x₄), ...
Level 2: z₁ = g(y₁, y₂), z₂ = g(y₃, y₄), ...
...
Output: f(x₁, ..., x₈) = g(...g(g(x₁,x₂), g(x₃,x₄))...)
```

**Properties**:
- Each `g` depends on only 2 variables
- Total function depends on 8 variables
- Depth: `O(log d)`, Width: bounded

## Neural Network Approximation Theory

### Universal Approximation for Compositional Functions

**Main Theorem**: If `f` is efficiently computable (polynomial time), then there exists a neural network with sparse connectivity that uniformly approximates `f`.

**Construction Idea**:
1. Decompose `f` into sparse constituent functions (guaranteed by P structure)
2. Each network layer approximates one constituent function
3. Composition of layers approximates overall function

### Approximation Guarantee

**Formal Statement**: For `f ∈ P` and any `ε > 0`, there exists neural network `N` such that:
```
sup_{x∈[0,1]^d} |f(x) - N(x)| ≤ ε
```

**Network Properties**:
- **Depth**: `L = O(depth of compositional decomposition)`
- **Width**: `W = O(max width of constituent functions)`
- **Parameters**: `O(L × W)` (polynomial in problem size)

### Threshold vs. ReLU Activations

**Threshold Functions**: `θ(x) = sign(x)`
- Directly implement Boolean operations
- Theoretical analysis cleaner

**ReLU Functions**: `σ(x) = max(0, x)`
- Practical implementation standard
- Can approximate threshold functions arbitrarily well

---

## Generalization and Rademacher Complexity

### Rademacher Complexity Definition

**Definition**: For function class `F` and sample `S = {x₁, ..., x_n}`:
```
R_n(F) = E_σ [sup_{f∈F} (1/n) Σᵢ σᵢ f(xᵢ)]
```
where `σᵢ` are independent Rademacher variables (uniform on `{±1}`).

**Interpretation**: Measures how well functions in `F` can correlate with random noise.

### Sparse Networks and Improved Bounds

**Standard Dense Network Bound**:
```
R_n(F) ≤ C √(W²L / n)
```
where `W` = width, `L` = depth.

**Sparse Network Bound**: If each layer has at most `s` non-zero weights per neuron:
```
R_n(F) ≤ C √(s²L / n)
```

**Improvement Factor**: `W²/s²` can be 10,000× or more in practice!

### Calculation Details

**Key Technique**: Bound spectral norms of sparse weight matrices.

**Standard Approach**: `‖W‖ ≤ ‖W‖_F ≤ √(total parameters)`

**Sparse Approach**: Exploit sparsity structure:
- Each row has at most `s` non-zeros
- `‖W‖ ≤ C√s` instead of `C√(total width)`

**Result**: Theory matches practice - bounds become meaningful (< 1) instead of vacuous (> 100,000).

## The Optimization Challenge

### The Fundamental Impossibility

**Theorem**: No algorithm can guarantee polynomial-time learning of arbitrary functions in general.

**Proof Sketch** (Cryptographic Argument):
1. Suppose algorithm `A` can learn any function efficiently
2. Consider encryption function `E(message, key) = ciphertext`
3. Given many (message, ciphertext) pairs, `A` would learn `E`
4. This breaks encryption ⟹ P = NP (widely believed false)

**Conclusion**: General function learning is computationally intractable.

### When Learning is Guaranteed

**Sufficient Condition**: Access to intermediate layer outputs.

**Setup**: Instead of just input-output pairs `(x, y)`, have:
```
Training Data: {(x, h₁, h₂, ..., h_L, y)}
```

**Algorithm**: Learn each layer separately:
```
f₁: x → h₁
f₂: h₁ → h₂
...
f_L: h_{L-1} → y
```

**Guarantee**: Each constituent function learnable in polynomial time.

### Connection to Autoregressive Learning

**Turing Machine Analogy**: 
- Standard: Only see initial input and final output
- Enhanced: See intermediate computation states

**Transformer Training**:
- **Input**: Sequence of tokens `w₁, w₂, ..., w_t`
- **Output**: Next token `w_{t+1}`
- **Key Insight**: Each position provides intermediate supervision!

**This explains Transformer success**: Autoregressive training provides the intermediate layer supervision that makes learning tractable.

## Transformers and Autoregressive Learning

### Architecture Components

**Self-Attention Mechanism**:
```
Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax(QK^T/√d_k)V
```
- **Q, K, V**: Query, Key, Value matrices
- **Multi-Head**: Multiple attention patterns in parallel

**Feed-Forward Networks**: 
- Two-layer MLPs in each Transformer block
- Provides compositional processing within each layer

### Autoregressive Training

**Objective**: Predict next token given history
```
P(w_{t+1} | w_1, w_2, ..., w_t)
```

**Key Advantage**: Rich supervision signal
- Each position in sequence provides training example
- Approximates "intermediate layer supervision" scenario

### Pre-training vs. Post-training

**Pre-training**: Next-token prediction on large text corpora
- Learns compositional structure of language
- Develops constituent function representations

**Post-training**: RLHF, instruction tuning, etc.
- **Hypothesis**: Primarily strengthens existing capabilities
- **Not creating new compositional structures**
- Similar to curriculum learning for humans

### Curriculum Learning

**Human Language Acquisition**:
1. Learn simple words and concepts
2. Gradually combine into complex sentences
3. Build compositional understanding incrementally

**Machine Learning Analog**:
- Start with simple problems/patterns
- Gradually increase complexity
- Exploit compositional structure for efficient learning

## Curse of Dimensionality and Solutions

### The Fundamental Problem

**Curse of Dimensionality**: Complexity grows exponentially with dimension `d`.

**Manifestations**:
1. **Volume**: Unit hypercube volume = 1, but almost all volume near boundary
2. **Sampling**: Need exponentially many samples to cover space uniformly  
3. **Optimization**: Number of local minima can grow exponentially

### Quantitative Example

**Function Storage**: Consider functions `f: {0,1}^d → {0,1}`
- **Total functions**: `2^{2^d}`
- **For d=10**: `2^{1024} ≈ 10^{308}` functions
- **For d=30**: `2^{2^{30}} ≈ 2^{10^9}` functions (astronomical!)

**Universe Comparison**: 
- Protons in observable universe ≈ `10^{80}`
- Even modest dimensions create intractable complexity

### Compositional Solution

**Key Insight**: Effective dimension is determined by constituent functions, not global function.

**Binary Tree Example Revisited**:
- **Global function**: `f: ℝ^{1000000} → ℝ`
- **Constituent functions**: Each `g: ℝ² → ℝ`
- **Effective dimension**: 2 (not 1,000,000!)

**Complexity Reduction**:
- **Without compositionality**: `O(2^d)`
- **With compositionality**: `O(2^k × depth)` where `k ≪ d`

### Biological Motivation

**Visual System Hierarchy**:
- **V1**: Edge detection (local features)
- **V2**: Texture, color patterns  
- **V4**: Object parts
- **IT**: Whole objects

**Computational Interpretation**: Each area computes sparse functions of lower-level features, building compositional representation.
